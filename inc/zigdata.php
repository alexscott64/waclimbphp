"content" => "A very small crew made it out on Dover island this past weekend and the weather was surprisingly pleasant. The team managed to put up three new exciting problems. The first one was a project found 10' to the right of the wave and has been named Une gripped d'homme (v7). The other two are highballs to the left of the Orantugan roof section. Although very obvious, the left to right dyke had not been climbed in fear of the holds breaking or simply of the height. Fear factor (v2) has good solid holds and the crux is low on the problem. Just to the right is One way street (v4), climbing past a number of sloping rails with a very bad fall potential. 
Ben and Rich also managed quick ascents of One scoop.",

The bulge project at the warm-up area saw its first ascent this week and was called Man of action. Then a sit-start to the v2-3 to the right of Une grippe d'homme produced an amazing problem named No Dents (v8). Behind The cave of the futur in the talus area is The sugar shack (v5). It traverses a seam from right to left then busts out a small roof and tops out tothe left. Finally the backside of the one scoop boulder has a fun left to right arete warm-up and also In the deep end (v7), a new problem starting in the hole and climbing out the face using the right arete and some terrible slopers.
