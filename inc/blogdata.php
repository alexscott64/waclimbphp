Their epic battle raged on, and from the dust and sweat, a new route was born: <b><i>Distraction V8</b></i>.<br><br>

It's outside, baby! You don't have to deal with Alex Megos hogging all the routes.<br><br>

    Now, I don't mind telling you that this climb kicked my ass. I had like seven different beta options to choose from, but nothing seemed to stick. And then my buddy Patrick Spaceman comes along and adds four more just for kicks. The guy's a genius, I tell you. It's probably easier if you're tall - I managed to space monkey my way through the bottom with some creative footwork.<br><br>
    
    The bottom of the climb was rough, though. Patrick Spaceman and I were flailing around like a couple of monkeys on a banana peel. But hey, we made it work. Patrick Spaceman thinks it's a V11, and you know what? I couldn't agree more. So if you're feeling brave, give it a shot after Papa Bear or Carbosaurus. I'd be willing to bet the grades are about the same. (Just kidding, don't come at me with pitchforks.)<br><br>
    
    Now, here's where things get interesting. This is the third project I've failed to complete that Patrick Spaceman has conquered. I'm starting to think he's got some kind of voodoo magic going on. I mean, can someone please put a curse on this guy so I can catch a break? I even hoped that the vaccine would coagulate his blood or turn him into a newt or something, but no such luck. The guy's a machine.<br><br>
    
    All in all, though, I can't complain. I'm out here doing what I love, pushing my limits, and having a blast with my friends. And let's be real, who needs to finish every climb when you've got good company and a few tales to tell?<br><br>Smizzle"]

    Let me paint you a picture. The sun is beating down on the rock, the air is thick with the smell of chalk and sweat, and all eyes are on Guillaume as he steps up to the climb. With the grace of a panther and the confidence of a king, he moves up the rock face, his fingers dancing across the crimps like they're made of silk.<br><br>
    
    And let me tell you, he makes it look easy. Surface Detail is a climb that demands precision, technique, and strength - all things that Guillaume has in spades. But even for the best of the best, this climb is a challenge.<br><br>
    
    But not for Guillaume. Oh no. He tackles it with the ease and nonchalance of a man out for a casual walk in the park. And watching him, you can't help but be inspired. This is what climbing is all about - pushing yourself to the limit, and then pushing a little further.<br><br>
    
    So here's to Guillaume, and here's to Surface Detail. May they continue to challenge and inspire climbers for years to come."]

    "paragraph" =>["21 one years ago, Greg Campbell published <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QNIKqhM-ku3HA_yoFWW1_zBaLhEdMpWE/view?usp=sharing'>Bouldering in Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>, providing some of the first documentation for many of our classic climbing areas. One of the guide’s biggest chapters, Herring Cove, was never added to Mobeta. The place has nonetheless remained a popular destination, especially since it’s within such a short drive of Halifax (about 20 minutes) and is even accessible by bus. I’m really grateful to have had the opportunity to finally post a guide to this site. It’s a great climbing area and I think people will enjoy it.<br><br>
    There is some great stuff here. <b><i>Widowmaker V4</b></i> will test your problem-solving. All that <b><i>Glitters V5</b></i> will test your willingness to match on a tiny freakin’ crimp. <b><i>Dyno Flatulator V2</b></i> is just a perfect little dyno. <b><i>Dyno Flatulator Traverse V5</b></i> asks: can you make that dyno after climbing a V4 wall?<br><br>
    This guide is not a comprehensive list of every problem in Herring Cove: there is a lot there. Instead, it’s a guide for the ‘Select’ section of Mobeta, meaning it’s a curated list of stuff that makes for a good climbing trip. The task of writing a ‘comprehensive’ section remains to be done, but in any case, you can find most of the missing problems on <a href='https://www.thecrag.com/en/climbing/canada/halifax/area/1018514937'>The Crag</a> or the <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QNIKqhM-ku3HA_yoFWW1_zBaLhEdMpWE/view?usp=sharing'>original guide.</a><br><br>
    I left out one very good section, Cemetery Wall, because the ground here slopes down to a huge cliff, and I didn’t want to send anyone to the actual cemetery. If you’re less yellow bellied than me, please do check it out on <a href='https://www.thecrag.com/climbing/canada/halifax/area/1020810243'>The Crag.</a><br><br>
    In general, I tried to stick with the original names and set-ups for problems, but I did make a few adjustments. Some of the names in the original guide were a bit spicy. Nice Jugs, Rim Job, Give ‘er Stink, etc. By strategically forgetting to write a few words, we can make this family-friendly: The Rim, Give ‘Er. (Nice Jugs didn’t make the cut).<br><br>
    In some cases, adjustments were unavoidable: nature moved huge rocks around at UFO and The Mole. I tried to get rid of any unnecessary rules (like ‘don’t use this crimp’) to bring it more in line with the current climbing culture. (It was hard to avoid rules on some problems, like Dyno Flatulator). In two cases, there was a more obvious way to do a problem, and I added the original as a variation. But in one case I went a bit further. I added a traverse to the beginning of <b><i>Give ‘Er</b></i> because the original only had two moves. With this natural extension, it’s a beautiful V3.<br><br>
    There are a few harder problems I hope will soon be added to round out the range of difficulty. Otherwise, I really appreciate any feedback on grades and ratings (i.e., what deserves a star, a heart, or a poop). Adding or subtracting problems is more difficult, and I can’t promise I’ll be available to do that work (since I’m becoming a father), but I’m happy to know if something wonderful got unlocked. For all such feedback, you can message me on <a href='https://www.instagram.com/tristan.cleveland/'>Instagram</a>.<br><br>
    Thank you Greg Campbell and all you other OG climbers that put this stuff together. And thanks to everyone who came out and helped me try problems, or who gave feedback on my original draft.<br><br>

My list was <b><i>Trap House</b></i>, <b><i>La Mer A Boire</b></i>, and <b><i>Big Dreamers</b></i>. Now that I've completed the list, I can tell you that Trap House is by far the best one, and Big Dreamers is by far the hardest and least pleasant. If you set this problem in a gym, you would be fired on the spot. It's one awkward move where you pull as hard as you can on some of the sharpest holds around. The key beta is figuring out which crystals dig better into skin and which dig better into tape.<br><br>

    So you have to wonder why a person would spend days working on that one move. When you pull on those two sharp holds, you can't help but marvel at the combination of glacial action, ocean storms, and freeze-thaw cycles that crafted this one move that sits right at the limit of my physical ability. It's not exactly a fun move in the traditional sense, but it's mentally engaging and emotionally rewarding in its own way. And it just happens to be placed in one of the most beautiful climbing locations I've ever been to. It's never going to be a popular problem, but maybe every few years someone will come along and try to pull on those holds. I hope they bring lots of tape."]

    All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.<br><br>
    
    They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.<br><br>
    
    You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.<br><br>"

    Remarkably, a high quality boulder has been hiding at Long Lake this whole time. [Story].
    <br><br>
    Two months ago, a friend told me he was climbing a cool boulder on the backside of Long Lake — and then the lockdown hit. I had to go on a solo expedition to find it, since groups weren’t allowed to climb together. When I did, I was grateful to have a spot to climb this close to the city while the gyms were closed. I was also grateful that the folks who found the boulder were generous in letting me clean it and write up a topo for it.
    <br><br>
    The spot has good problems in the V3 to V4 range, and one mega-hard project. It’s right on the lake, a pleasant spot to spend an afternoon. The walk in is about 20 minutes long, through nature trails and along Long Lake. 
    <br><br>
    Directions: Park at the Saint Margarets Bay Road parking lot or Exhibition Park, walk to Long Lake, and then follow the shore counter-clockwise until you run into a big boulder. The boulder faces east and is shaded in the afternoon. 
    
    ","
    
    <b>Black Belt</b>
    <br><br>
    When you arrive at the boulder, you are greeted by a large slab that is decent for warming up, but not much else. I’ve clumped the problems here together in one entry because they’re nothing to write home about.
    <br><br>
    On the left, there is one problem that certainly is worth the climb, Black Belt V4. This problem is a bit of a puzzle, requiring more technique than strength, and is on the easier side of V4 once you get the beta. 
    
    
    ","
    
    <b>Apogee and Apotheosis</b>
    <br><br>
    The star of the show is Apogee V3. There is something aesthetically pleasing about when it seems like someone designed the holds on a boulder to create a climbing problem. In this case, it’s a mix of crimps, pockets, and jugs, and ends with two large satisfying moves. 
    <br><br>
    Apotheosis V4 offers a different, harder entrance to Apogee. The starting move feels baffling until the beta clicks, and when it does, it feels like ‘the elevation of someone to divine status’ — i.e., apotheosis.
    <br><br>
    Kickstand is an unremarkable V1. If you’ve climbed everything else and are looking for one last challenge, try linking Apogee into Kickstand. The transition is surprisingly tricky. For me it involved hanging upside-down from a heel hook. 
    
    ","
    
    <b>Near Death</b>
    <br><br>
    Near Death, like Apogee, stands out aesthetically for having designer hand holds. It starts on two solid crimps, and moves to a nice little crimp carved into the wall (not literally). The hardest move is the first, requiring solid feet position to move statically to the crimp. After that, a variety of beta do the trick. The problem is named after the giant jug that <a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/CPpBOzYH-VZ/'>came off</a> mid-climb.
    
    ","
    
    Next to Near Death is a hard, hard project. I look forward to someone sending that. 
    <br><br>
    I hope you enjoy the boulder. As always, I’d appreciate any feedback on grades etc. You can DM me on <a href='https://www.instagram.com/tristan.cleveland/'>Instagram</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/LUrbaniste'>Twitter</a>.

"paragraph" =>
["Archeologists say that many of Nova Scotia’s best climbing spots were established back in the 90s. Mobeta has done a great job documenting most of those sites, but one never quite made its way in: <a href='http://www.cnsmobeta.ca/topo.php?topo=8000&full=y'>Duncan’s Cove</a>.<br><br>

My brother, Teth Cleveland, wrote <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KjUXpVVPnzmpKLvnNcuurdYPha5KII1E/view?usp=sharing'>a guide for Chebucto Head</a> that included Duncan’s Cove back in 2002, with the help of Jonathan Graham and a few other climbers. Recently, we went with a crew of climbers to dust off the area and see which climbs remain.

<h2>Jazzberry Ram</h2>

<p class='w3-left-align'>Turns out there have been some big changes. Take the Jazzberry Ram Wall, which had a massive crack traverse — until half the wall fell off.<br><br>", 

"Every problem from #5 leftward no longer exists. The remaining crack traverse is a tiny fraction of its former glory (and too full of silverfish for me to re-do). There may be some new problems here, but you probably want a top rope. The wall is very tall. It may be worth further investigation for the intrepid. <br><br>


<h2>Robar Boulder</h2>

<p class='w3-left-align'>Then there’s the Robar boulder, which had a V7 on it called Robar Direct. It has since split directly in two, and Robar is now lying face-down on the ground. <br><br>",

"But, when you break a rock, it turns out there’s more rock under it. Ben Rose established a new problem in its place named <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09u88kfV1wA'>Rebar V4</a> in honour of Robar (and in honour of the rebar sticking out of the WWII machine gun boxes around the corner). It’s a scary problem because if you’re not careful, you’ll fall onto Robar’s corpse and break an ankle. But if you have a few spotters, it’s a good one. <br><br>


<h2>The Scoop</h2>

<p class='w3-left-align'>However, some of the problems are still in mint condition. ",



"The Scoop (problem #3) was listed as a classic in the guidebook. It’s a beautiful, aesthetically-unique rock, and a great V2. My personal favourite on the block is Little Crack, #4, which is a tricky V3 that lends itself to a variety of beta. It was listed as V2 in the original guide, but I climbed it with half-a-dozen people and it felt like a solid V3. <br><br>


<h2>Book of Mobeta</h2>

<p class='w3-left-align'>Strangely, there was an amazing little climb right next to The Scoop that wasn’t in the original guide. I can only assume that rocks must have blocked it back then, because it stands out as an obvious climb. <br><br>",


"Ben Rose also did the first ascent on this as well, and christened it <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mb7euSlLbBE'>The Book of Mobeta V3</a> (a reference to The Book of Mormon). This is a certain kind of climbing problem boiled to its essence: flat wall, tight crimps, go up. It’s not quite as hard as I hoped, mostly because the feet are so good. Although, looking at the photo, there may be some harder options to the left.<br><br>


<h2>The Orifice</h2> 

<p class='w3-left-align'>Also, there is another enticing section of flat wall, a bit further down the coast, which we haven’t climbed yet. The old guide lists everything here as V0 to V2, but I suspect there is harder stuff. I couldn’t get off the ground on a supposed V2, so it’s possible things have changed. (The photo shows only a small section of the wall.)<br><br>",

"The only trouble is, it’s a pain in the neck to get here from Chebucto Head, so anyone curious may need to explore other access options. (Please don’t trek through people’s backyards). Might be worth a go some sunny day. 

Here’s a diagram showing how to get to the Duncan’s Cove Problems without trespassing.",




"The area has other old problems waiting to be re-established, and I think, new problems to send. I didn’t spot any harder problems, though they may be there. All in all, the area seems like a good destination if you climb in the V2-to-V4 range, or if you feel like warming up on some old-school problems before hitting Tsunami.<br><br>

If you climb here and add anything, let me know: tristancleveland@gmail.com.",]

["Earlier this summer, my brother (Teth Cleveland) and I hacked a new path to <a href='http://www.cnsmobeta.ca/topo.php?topo=5800&full=y'>Porcupine Fortress</a>. I’m happy to hear more climbers are now visiting the spot. It’s a special place, with a path that winds through tiny gaps between big boulders, and a spectacular view of a lake to reward you when you finish climbs. It also has amazing climbs, including my favourite V4 in Nova Scotia, <b><i><a href='https://youtu.be/vcUojFcGjg8'>Confidence</a></b></i>.", 

"PSA: Please note that the landowners request that people not use the trail going to Porcupine Fortress during hunting season, Friday October 27 to December 2nd. 

<br><br>I developed a few new problems at Porcupine Fortress this summer. One in particular is worth highlighting: <b><i><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqOvodTLTBs'>Step Function V3</b></i></a> (FA: Ben Rose). It involves a big reach out to a crack on the right (or rather, the jug formed by the crack), and then working up slopers on the left while the crack on the right gets smaller. Most of the problem, however, is in the footwork, since there is a giant gap where you would like to put your feet. It’s a fun little puzzle. Also, the top-out is refreshingly not sketchy, with a positive edge to grab onto.  

<br><br>We’re still working on a harder variant to Step Function, which I invite you to try out. In this version, you start under the overhang and make a huge reach out to the crack, pinching it while you (desperately try to) get your body up and around the overhang. Then it gets harder. It’s probably a V4 or V5. Give it a try and let me know if you send it.",

"The other new problems are mostly warm-ups or a good challenge for beginners: <b><i><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc78OmFKJRk'>Log Rhythm V1</a></b></i>, <b><i><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SmcoplVGRo'>Algae Rhythm V0</b></i></a>, and <b><i><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Bu5MxIHGh8'>Torpedo Bay V2</b></i></a>. My favourite of the bunch is <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNa-tkCcOXM'> <b><i>Cantilever V2</b></i></a>. While it’s a bit of a two-move wonder, the big move to the left is satisfying, and I find it highly recreational to go fully horizontal. All-in-all, the new additions help round out the spot as a good destination for climbers of all levels, with solid problems ranging from V0 to V8.

<br><br>Developing problems is an extremely fun hobby. Thanks to Patrick Spaceman for letting me post here about it, and thanks to Teth Cleveland and Ben Rose clearing the trail and working beta with me. Enjoy and keep sending."],

"    I went out to check this wall in CCB a while ago lured in by the potential for a new project after the ocean destroyed <b>Stealth Pants</b>. The stealth pants line was not good, but I scoped out this new wall with some dope overhanging projects.<br><br>

Then I forgot about the wall for like 4 years. I went back with Patrick Spaceman. I think he wanted to film some gross turd lines, and he said something about pokemons, but I had secret plans...<br><br>

I knew that even a hardened turd slayer, a reckless survivor of the grossness of <b>Prospect</b>, would be unable to stomach the nastiness of uncensored Crystal Crescent lines. So we were definitely going to end up groping dope projects. I was like a young Machiavelli.<br><br>

We looked at the main area but it was pretty bad. The climbs were camouflaged by the hiking trail which looked pretty much the same.",

"Trying to find actual lines was like one of those optical illusions you have to stare at for 5 minutes till your eyes cross.",

"In contrast the project wall was super good. 3 lines. At the time, there was one realistic line using dope and sophisticated foot work and gross crimps. The end featured a big move to a bad sloper. We were both pretty close. But I was definately closer. I could have done it. It was bad conditions. I trained the day before. Molly ate my chalk.",

"There were 2 other lines that got labelled smizz projects. They are definitely doable though.<br><br>

By the way, Patrick Spaceman did the new line. I saw the video. It looks good. He says its V9, but I saw a top secret technical innovation so its probably 10+... He says bitcoins solve grade inflation, but I think its mostly 8 years of unrelenting grippin."

"Guest contributor: Tristan Cleveland<br><br>

17 years ago my brother, Teth Cleveland, stumbled on an enticing set of rocks with fellow climber Jonathan Graham. He recently took me to have another look and our minds were both blown by the number of climbs waiting to happen in a small area. We both got hooked, and after a few months of hard work, we're pleased to introduce <a href=''>Sideshow</a>. (<a href='https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=10BvSXgiZEQ_ORVoEf05IXwCRiGVyC7tU&ll=44.52532156035005%2C-64.02294673916322&z=18'>Here's the map.</a> The drive is about 10 minutes longer than the LOC.)<br><br>

Developing a new climbing area is a fun and strange hobby. I never thought I would enjoy scrubbing so much. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether a problem will turn out to be just a turd after all the digging and scraping, but I'm glad to say some were gems. <br><br>


<b>Bob and Doug</b><br><br>

The coolest boulder I've had the pleasure of developing is the Bob & Doug boulder, below. The main problem, Doug (<a href='https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=10BvSXgiZEQ_ORVoEf05IXwCRiGVyC7tU&ll=44.52532156035005%2C-64.02294673916322&z=18'>#2. FA Ben Rose</a>), took me 5 sessions to climb (it's V4, which is where I max out). It has the twin virtues of being challenging while still having lots of features to play with, offering multiple viable betas. I've lovingly diagrammed the holds below. <br><br>

There's a variation worth trying in which you exclude the second arret. This incorporates another set of interesting moves and makes for a more consistent level of difficulty to the end. That variation has yet to be sent.  ",
"<b> Gym Wall</b><br><br>

We call this wall the 'gym wall' because it has so many holds and potential directions to climb. It's a great warm-up wall, with a collection of V0's to V2's. It's unusual to have V1 climbing that incorporates an overhang, which is fun. (If you want a V3 here, try finishing #4 directly upwards instead of veering right. Hasn't been done yet.) ",
"<b>Hard stuff</b><br><br>

There are four hard projects, in the V5 to V10 range, that we cleaned just so someone else can climb them. This rock below calls out to be climbed, doesn't it? I scrubbed a big section of dirt and moss off the top so that it'll be ready for the epic climber who wants to send it",
"The other especially-hard one is Project #3, below. It starts on a little flake undercling. There's at least one tiny, tiny pinch on the right and a cruel crimp to the left. I suspect it's in the V8 to V10 range, and should be satisfying. Project #4 is less hard, probably a V5 or so. It has a number of options to start, including a two-finger slot. Project #2 has big, easy holds for getting off the ground, but it might not be possible to go further. (I hope someone takes that as a challenge.)",
" I'm stoked that on our last visit, Ben Rose sent #9, Double Agent <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5nbkzHhT5I&feature=youtu.be'>(video).</a> It's a V4 that combines technique and power. It starts with a lunge from tiny crimps to a big rail, and ends with a scrunchy heel hook and a side pull. Right-proper cool.",
" My brother Teth named #11 after the first thing he said when he finished the problem: 'Everything I hoped it'd be.' <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-E_pGrfA0&fbclid=IwAR1DzViykMyI53lH6rFf6yGMHmkrG_qM7QKpmob2_wySDu4Mi2s3JKFPJxE'>(video.)</a> My neighbouring problem, Undercover V3 (#12, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K9PCVQVH-8&feature=youtu.be'>(video)</a>), is a similar beast: fun cave climbing with a jug ladder and a more-technical traverse to top out. It was a satisfying reward after 30 minutes of cleaning.<br><br>


<b>Clockwork</b>",
"Clockwork V3 (#16 FA: Ben Rose, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpPSwfaH2dY&feature=youtu.be'>video</a>) has one of the oddest starting betas I've seen (at least the way we do it). It involves crossing both hands and feet, and placing a high heel hook in a wedge to get off the ground. It's weird yet satisfying when it clicks.<br><br>

On our last day at Sideshow, we were just wrapping up a few problems to post here when we stumbled on a whole other overhanging boulder with at least 3 good problems on it. It looks like it might be on par with Bob & Doug, so there's more here to do! There are also some slabs and other potential problems that we haven't cleaned, so there is more here to play with if you like development. <br><br>

I would love to hear about it if you try out the spot, and would especially if anyone gets those hard ones! (Tag me on <a href='https://www.instagram.com/tristan.cleveland/?hl=en'>Instagram</a>). Have fun!",

"The ocean destroyed the world class <b><i>Strong Boy Project</b></i> for eternity, but has given us back <b><i>Aquaman V5</b></i> by removing the boulder blocking it. Tyler Durden's monologue comes to mind:<br><br>

<i>\"You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you. He never wanted you. In all probability, he HATES you.\"</i><br><br>

The first time I made the long approach to Crystal Crescent for the \"3-star classic\" <b><i>Aquaman V5</b></i>, I nearly quit bouldering. If this is the pinnacle of climbing in Nova Scotia - I'm out. Fortunately, Zig didn't make that topo, and the first ascentionist was <i>REALLY</i> psyched on it, so Zig just went along with it. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6PRtt_jLUE'>Everyone loves their own brand.</a><br><br>",

"Don't bother getting out the Bristol Stool Chart out for this one, <b><i>Aquaman V5</b></i> is the every kind of turd: <br><br>

<i>Arbitrary, Lowball, Lip Traverse, Eliminate, Awkward, Scrunchy, Multiple rules.</i><br><br>

The 90s were a dark time for bouldering in Nova Scotia. This was one of the best test pieces of the era. <br><br>

If you are interested in climbing this turd for historical purposes, here are the rules:<br><br>

<i>Start on the seam and traverse left, until you encounter the vertical crack. You can climb up the crack, but not too high, and arbitrarily avoid topping out the natural seam. Instead, traverse the lip, but not too high on the lip cause it gets easier the higher up you go, and that's cheating, so stay as low as you can until you hit the jug. Keep traversing the lip, and avoid topping out again, and instead down climb to the middle seam. The upper lip at this point is out, even though both options are V0 lip traverses. Do the lower and more awkward V0 traverse 3 feet off the ground with no foot holds. You could have exited at any point, but you can now legally topout at the far corner.</i>"

Nova Scotia has countless arête climbs, but few are as beautiful as Nick Sagar's <b>Last Chance V10</b>. <br><br>

What makes <b>Last Chance</b> so outstanding is wonderful defined holds the whole way upon both the arête and the face. No blind slapping for nebulous crystals here. Last Chance is refined movement with nuanced footwork and high body tension on crimps, side pulls, pinches, and underclings. The top is committing but secure.<br><br>

The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star classic is an unfortunate landing into a widening chasm. <br><br>

If this description has you psyched to hop on Last Chance as your next project, this week is probably your Last Chance... The arête holds bake in the sun starting in the morning and it's getting harder every passing day. The black flies at owl's house are truly nightmarish right now. I'd advise waiting until the fall."

Sean's super smooth send using the back step jump to the lip was the first major innovation.",
"I used a heel hook for the transition that makes the opening sequence much easier. I can stand comfortably on the bottom shelf and the crux transition becomes casual heel hook instead of an insecure toe hook.",

Quinpool Shoe Repair has a 4.8 rating on google and did an amazing job bringing 2 pairs back to life. They don't resole climbing shoes, but can fix just about any damage. On my Futura's they fixed a peeling toe hook patch with a bomber glue job and even a little stitch to hopefully keep it down longer. They also fixed the dreaded broken lace on a pair of solutions.<br><br>

In today's world of disposable consumption, fast, friendly, inexpensive service from a local shop was a treat! ",

quintessential NS pebble wrestling",

"The moonboard has benchmark climbs - but so does outdoor climbing. A new icon has been added to denote climbs of exceptional quality, consistency, and solid difficulty for each grade.<br><br>

After sending Ghislain's magnum opus <b><i>RTK V12</b></i> at hospital hill, friends convinced me I couldn't put off benchmarking against Nick Sagar's masterpiece <b><i>Grizzly V11</b></i> any longer. Grizzly is quintessential NS pebble wrestling and undoubtedly one of Nova Scotia's most recognised benchmarks. A rare opportunity to direcly compare Nova Scotia's best OG test pieces.<br><br>

I'm glad I listened. Grizzly is a completely different beast compared to RTK but magnificent in it's own right.  RTK is a rare climb by NS standards. Nightmarish crimps and powerful shoulder moves are Ghislain's speciality. Nick Sagar showcased a completely different skill set with burly biceps compression and open handed sloper fest on Grizzly. It's a war of attrition against your finger skin. The name is fitting since it feels like you are wrestling a bear. The committing slab topout is a Nova Scotia classic.<br><br>

One thing both climbs have in common is world class quality.
